# Laptop Price Prediction 
This is a Machine Learning project focused on predicting Laptop prices. The goal is to find the answer of the following questions. 
a. Identify the top 5 laptop brands by the number of products listed.
b. Find the average price of laptops for each brand. Identify which brand has the highest and lowest average price.
c. Present the correlation between Price_euros and other numeric features such as CPU_freq, Ram, Inches, and Weight. Identify which features are most correlated with price.
d. Create a new feature, StorageTotal, by summing PrimaryStorage and SecondaryStorage.
e. Build a regression model using features like Ram, Inches, CPU_freq, PrimaryStorage, and GPU_company to predict the Price_euros of a laptop. Suggest the best regression model
f. Create a classification model to predict the laptop type (TypeName) based on features such as Inches, Ram, PrimaryStorage, and Weight. Identify which features are the most important in your classification model. Suggest the best classification model
