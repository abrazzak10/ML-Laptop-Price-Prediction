# Laptop Price Prediction 
This is a Machine Learning project focused on predicting laptop prices and exploring various insights from the dataset.
## Project Objectives:
### Brand Analysis
i. Identify the top 5 laptop brands by the number of products listed.
ii. Calculate the average laptop price for each brand and identify the highest and lowest average priced brands.
### Feature Correlation:
iii. Analyze the correlation between Price_euros and numeric features like:
-CPU_freq
-Ram
-Inches
-Weight
iv. Identify which features are most correlated with price.

## Feature Engineering
v. Create a new feature: StorageTotal = PrimaryStorage + SecondaryStorage.
### Regression Modeling:
vi. Build regression models using features like:
-Ram
-Inches
-CPU_freq
-PrimaryStorage
-GPU_company
vii. Predict Price_euros and suggest the best regression model based on performance.
## Classification Modeling:
viii. Create a classification model to predict the laptop type (TypeName) based on:
-Inches
-Ram
-PrimaryStorage
-Weight
ix. Identify the most important features and suggest the best classification model.
## Tools & Libraries Used:
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Data Manipulation**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`  
- **Visualization**: `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`  
- **Machine Learning**: `Scikit-learn
